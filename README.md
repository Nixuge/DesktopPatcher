# What's this
This is just a simple programs that adds `env XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=gnome` to desktop files so they use the Gnome file picker

This is made because of how awful the default file picker is on i3/bspwm/probably other wms

# How to use
### Using the .py script
- Grab the python script
- Run it
- Done
### Using pacman hooks
- Install the package located [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtkpickeradder-hook) 
   
All done, the hook will run when installing/upgrading an app supported by this script

# Need support another app
