# GTKPickerAdder
## What's this
This is just a simple programs that adds `env XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=gnome` to desktop files so they use the Gnome file picker

This is made because of how awful the default file picker is on i3/bspwm/probably other wms

## How to use
### Using the .py script
- Grab the python script
- Run it
- Done
### Using pacman hooks
\<todo once the file is published to the arch aur>
